# CHAPTER 4 - COURSE ENROLLMENT AND LESSON PROGRESS

## Enrollment and Progress Management

This chapter adds functionality for enrolling users in courses, tracking lesson completion, calculating progress, and managing enrollments.

### Enroll in a Course

To enroll a user in a course:

**POST**  
`http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments/enroll/:courseId`

Replace `:courseId` with the actual course ID.

---

### Complete a Lesson

To mark a lesson as completed by a user:

**POST**  
`http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments/complete/:courseId/:lessonId`

Replace `:courseId` and `:lessonId` with the actual IDs.

---

### Track Course Progress

You can calculate how far along a user is in a course by comparing the number of completed lessons to the total lessons in that course.

**GET**  
`http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments/progress/:courseId`

This returns the user's progress for a specific course as a percentage.

---

### Cancel Completion of a Lesson

To remove a lesson from the list of completed lessons for a user:

**DELETE**  
`http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments/cancel/:courseId/:lessonId`

---

### Count Enrolled Students

To find out how many students are enrolled in a particular course:

**GET**  
`http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments/count/:courseId`

This returns the total number of users enrolled in the course.

The request should include the `userId` (the ID of the user) to check enrollment information specific to that user.

To run the project, you need to install the necessary dependencies and start the project with the command `docker-compose up --build`.
